AI 에이전트는 보다 발전된 개인 맞춤형 AI 비서, 동반자(companion)를 의미한다. 코파일럿을 AI 에이전트로 정의, 향후 이 시장을 마이크로소프트가 선도하겠다는 의지를 밝힌 셈이다.\\xa0발전된 AI 비서, AI 에이전트에 대한 기대감은 오픈AI의 ‘데브데이(DevDay)’ 이후 급격히 고조되는 분위기다. 과거에도 음성 인식으로 작동하는 시리, 알렉사, 구글 어시스턴트 등 AI 비서 서비스가 존재했지만, 이 서비스가 실제로 수행할 수 있는 작업은 많지 않았다.\\xa0한데, 오픈AI가 데브데이에서 맞춤형 챗GPT ‘GPTs’를 시연하자 개발자들을 비롯한 기술 업계 관계자들의 분위기가 바뀌었다. 매우 쉽게, 놀라운 성능을 낼 수 있다는 사실이 확인됐기 때문이다. 샘 알트만 오픈AI CEO는 스타트업 액셀러레이터 와이콤비네이터의 사장을 지낸 자신처럼 창업가에게 조언을 해주는 챗GPT를 몇 분만에 만들어 보이기도 했다.빌 게이츠 마이크로소프트 창업자가 9일 “마이크로소프트의 윈도우 이후 가장 큰 컴퓨팅 혁명”이라고 밝힌 것도 같은 맥락이다. AI 에이전트는 인간과 컴퓨터가 소통하기 위한 연결 고리가 되고, AI 에이전트의 엔진인 ‘대규모 언어 모델(LLM)’은 일종의 운영시스템(OS) 지위를 차지할 수 있을 것으로 본 것이다.
